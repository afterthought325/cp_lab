	~~~Diamond Box~~~
0 x*** -> N 0 ## If there isn't a wall to the North, move North
0 N*** -> X 1 ## If there is a wall to the north, switch to State 1


1 ***x -> S 1 ## If there isn't a wall to the South, move South
1 ***S -> X 2 ## If there is a wall to the South, switch to state 2

2 **x* -> W 0 ## If there isn't a wall to the west move west, then Loop back up in down
2 **WS -> X 3 ## If there is a wall to the West and South

## This solves the stuck going up the stairs problem, Move north one and then west
3 x*** -> N 4
3 NxWS -> E 5 ##If Stuck in a Western Corner, Jump to 5 to loop east till wall

4 x*x* -> W 0 ##Move West after walking up Stairs then Loop Back to Start
